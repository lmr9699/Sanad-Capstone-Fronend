# SANAD — Cursor Rules

This directory contains rules and instructions for AI-assisted development.

## Files

- **`instractions.md`** — Main project instructions and patterns
- **`HARD_RULES.md`** — Mandatory rules that must be followed at all times

## Quick Reference

### Hard Rules Summary:

1. ❌ Do NOT invent new features or screens
2. ❌ Do NOT change design/wording/spacing/colors without approval
3. ❌ Do NOT delete/rename/reorganize files without asking
4. ❌ Do NOT refactor without proposing a plan first
5. ❌ Do NOT commit secrets — use .env (gitignored)

### Always:

- ✅ Match provided designs exactly (pixel-for-pixel)
- ✅ Use existing theme values from `theme/` directory
- ✅ Follow existing code patterns
- ✅ Ask before making changes
- ✅ Preserve existing functionality

## Approval Process

When you want to make changes that violate hard rules:

1. **STOP**
2. **PROPOSE** your plan
3. **WAIT** for approval
4. **PROCEED** only after approval
