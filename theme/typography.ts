/**
 * SANAD — Typography
 *
 * Clear hierarchy with comfortable line heights
 *
 * HIERARCHY:
 * - Screen titles: display (28px) — main page heading
 * - Section headers: h1 (24px) or h2 (20px) — major sections
 * - Body text: body (16px) — primary content
 * - Helper/caption: caption (14px) minimum — supporting text, labels
 *
 * MINIMUM SIZES:
 * - No fonts smaller than 14px for readable text
 * - overline (12px) and label (13px) reserved for UI-only elements (tab bar, badges)
 * - Always pair fontSize with lineHeight for readability
